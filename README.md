Interview Project 

I have created this project using NodeJs to run JS code on server-side, ExpressJs to simplify the routing on website, and for database service i have used MongoDB to achieve future scability.
<br>
I have cetegorized whole code in Routes for router, Model for Schema, Controller for api and middleware to validate the data to get structured data.
<br>
->DATABASE
In database i have added two collections Fisrt User and Secound Task collection. In user collection i have assign user info like username, email, and role. And in Task collection i have assign task title, description and status.
<br>
->Useage
User can register and assign task to their self and rate the work progress in five level(such as "TO_DO", "IN_PROGRESS", "BLOCKED", "IN_REVIEW", "DONE").
User can add, edit, mark and delete the task by their self and also they can find all the task that are happening.
<br>
->Validation
User can't add invalid Emile Id and also user can't assign task status else then five level.
